                    <br>
                    When my aunt (full of japes)
                    <br>
                    Offered a handful of "grapes"
                    <br>

                <p>I have a cat that I dedicate time to every day.  A little more than that when he's sick.  
                    He's fond of taking walks outside on a leash (less to protect the birds and small animals than it is to save him from traffic).
                    We meander around, and he chases just about any insect we happen upon. 
                    <br>
                    Except wasps.  He's finally learned to leave them alone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a computer science major, I feel obligated to say that I like computers.  When they work, anyway.  About eight years ago I built my first,
                    and I've been slowly changing the parts out to keep it from getting too old.  I won't claim to be an expert, but it turns out you don't need to be
                    for people to ask you to put them together.  None of them have caught fire yet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other than that, I've been dabbling in game development.  I don't know if it will go anywhere.  I've found it to be rewarding when it goes right
                    and disappointing when it goes wrong.  The amount to do is daunting if I think too much about it, and like any good developer I keep adding more features so the project can go on forever.
